These platforms also account for the vast majority of research on the topic. However, in most of the world, particularly in Global South countries, misinformation often reaches citizens through social media messaging apps, particularly WhatsApp. To fill the resulting gap in the literature, we conducted a multimedia deactivation experiment to test the impact of reducing exposure to potential sources of misinformation on WhatsApp during the weeks leading up to the 2022 Presidential election in Brazil. We find that this intervention significantly reduced participants’ exposure to false rumors circulating widely during the election. However, consistent with theories of mass media minimal effects, a short-term reduction in exposure to misinformation ahead of the election did not lead to significant changes in belief accuracy, political polarization, or well-being.","tags":["Social Media"," Misinformation","WhatsApp","Elections","Global South"],"title":"Misinformation Exposure Beyond Traditional Feeds: Evidence from a WhatsApp Deactivation Experiment in Brazil","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Bernhard Clemm von Hohenberg","Tiago Ventura","Ericka Menchen-Trevino","Jonathan Nagler","Magdalena Wojcieszak"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1721072110,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721072110,"objectID":"86697e54dd94c6b6322b310a2e662793","permalink":"https://www.venturatiago.com/talk/professionals/","publishdate":"2024-07-15T15:35:10-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/professionals/","section":"talk","summary":"Online panels have become an important resource for research in political science, but the financial compensation involved incentivizes respondents to become survey professionals, which raises concerns about data quality. We provide evidence on survey professionalism using behavioral web browsing data from three U.S. samples, recruited via Lucid, YouGov, and Facebook (total n = 3,886). Survey professionalism is common but varies across samples: By our most conservative measure, we identify 1.7 percentof respondents on Facebook, 7.9 percent of respondents on YouGov, and 34.3 percentof respondents on Lucid as survey professionals. However, evidence that professionals lower data quality is limited: they do not systematically differ demographically or politically from non-professionals and do not respond more randomly—although they are somewhat more likely to speed, to straightline, and to take questionnaires repeatedly. While concerns are warranted, we conclude that survey professionals do not, by and large, distort inferences of research based on online panels.","tags":["Social Media"," Misinformation","WhatsApp","Elections","Global South"],"title":"Survey Professionalism: New Evidence from Web Browsing Data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Natalia Aruguete","Ernesto Calvo","Tiago Ventura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1719689710,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719689710,"objectID":"c87e7dea1f45e4d6b608fba727263bed","permalink":"https://www.venturatiago.com/talk/reputation/","publishdate":"2024-06-29T15:35:10-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/reputation/","section":"talk","summary":"This article presents a novel experiment measuring the reputation and ideological costs fact-checkers face when informing voters about the accuracy of messages.

In a well-powered, pre-registered survey experiment conducted during the 2021 mid-term election in Argentina when COVID-19 was a polarizing issue, we exposed 5,757 respondents to real tweets about the number of COVID-19 cases in Argentina, followed by fact-checking corrections. Results show that pro-attitudinal messages increased the quality rating of the fact-checker, Chequeado, and made respondents perceive the organization ideologically closer to their own views. Counter-attitudinal fact-checking also increases the perceived quality but has no significant effect on ideological contrast of the fact-checker.

This article reports a four-country survey experiment assessing the influence of confirmation and refutation frames on engagement with online fact-checks. Respondents randomly received semantically identical content, either affirming accurate information (“It is TRUE that p”) or refuting misinformation (“It is FALSE that not p”). Despite semantic equivalence, confirmation frames elicit higher engagement rates than refutation frames. Additionally, confirmation frames reduce self-reported negative emotions related to polarization. These findings are crucial for designing policy interventions aiming to amplify fact-check exposure and reduce affective polarization, particularly in critical areas such as health-related misinformation and harmful speech.","tags":["misinformation","fact-checking","motivated reasoning","experiment"],"title":"Framing fact-checks as a “confirmation” increases engagement with corrections of misinformation: a four-country study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tiago Ventura","Sandra Ley","Francisco Cantu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705952110,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705952110,"objectID":"2764262217d3e5e23f7c71f5ab48ad53","permalink":"https://www.venturatiago.com/publication/voting_violence_mex/","publishdate":"2024-01-22T15:35:10-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/voting_violence_mex/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we examine the demand-and-supply dynamic of security policies. We argue there are two informational shortcuts through which voters process policy alternatives and choose among them: (1) their own personal experiences with violence and (2) candidates’ profiles. We test our argument through an original survey experiment conducted in Mexico. We model voters’ decisions to support candidates campaigning over a variety of security proposals. Our survey design takes advantage of recent developments in network models to better measure the effects of crime exposure on voters’ preferences. We find that higher exposure to crime victimization is associated with increased support for only some iron-fist policies, therefore highlighting the importance of unpacking security policies instead of generalizing the results of crime exposure. We show null effects of partisan advantages and reveal the role of non-partisan heuristics, such as the candidate’s professional experience, in preferences for security policies.","tags":["Violence","Punitive Preferences","Network Models","Victimization"],"title":"Voting for Law and Order: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aniket Kesari","Jae Kim","Sono Shah","Taylor Brown","Tina Law","Tiago Ventura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698089710,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698089710,"objectID":"22e510e2b9a3d7c6adbf77e40aa5e8c1","permalink":"https://www.venturatiago.com/publication/pedagogy/","publishdate":"2023-10-23T15:35:10-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pedagogy/","section":"publication","summary":"Social scientists with data science skills increasingly are assuming positions as computational social scientists in academic and non-academic organizations. However, because computational social science (CSS) is still relatively new to the social sciences, it can feel like a hidden curriculum for many PhD students. To support social science PhD students, this article is an accessible guide to CSS training based on previous literature and our collective working experiences in academic, public-, and private-sector organizations. We contend that students should supplement their traditional social science training in research design and domain expertise with CSS training by focusing on three core areas: (1) learning data science skills, (2) building a portfolio that uses data science to answer social science questions, and (3) connecting with computational social scientists. We conclude with practical recommendations for departments and professional associations to better support PhD students.","tags":["computational social science","professional","teaching"],"title":"Training Computational Social Science PhD Students for Academic and Non-Academic Careers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalia Aruguete","Ingrid Bachman","Ernesto Calvo","Sebastian Valenzuela","Tiago Ventura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686080110,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686080110,"objectID":"1fdb2567db119970d258a9a474de53f3","permalink":"https://www.venturatiago.com/publication/truth_be_told/","publishdate":"2023-06-06T15:35:10-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/truth_be_told/","section":"publication","summary":"When do users share fact-checks on social media? We describe a survey experiment conducted during the 2019 election in Argentina measuring the propensity of voters to share corrections to political misinformation that randomly confirm or challenge their initial beliefs. We find evidence of selective sharing—the notion that individuals prefer to share pro-attitudinal rather than counter-attitudinal fact-checks. This effect, however, is conditioned by the type of adjudication made by fact-checkers. More specifically, in line with motivated reasoning processes, respondents report a higher intent to share confirmations (i.e. messages fact-checked with a “true” rating) compared with refutations (i.e. messages fact-checked with a “false” rating). Experimental results are partially confirmed with a regression discontinuity analysis of observational data of Twitter and replicated with additional experiments. Our findings suggest that fact-checkers could increase exposure to their verifications on social media by framing their corrections as confirmations of factually correct information.","tags":["misinformation","fact-checking","motivated reasoning","experiment"],"title":"Truth be told: Cognitive moderators of selective sharing of fact-checks on social media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tiago Ventura","Ernesto Calvo","Silvio Waisbord","Natalia Aruguete"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672704000,"objectID":"e4728a473fdc2bd23b7b30e65c485013","permalink":"https://www.venturatiago.com/publication/adjudication/","publishdate":"2023-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adjudication/","section":"publication","summary":"This article analyzes social media engagement when elections are adjudicated to one of the contending parties.

Results show that partisans share more content than non-partisans and that their preferences become over-represented. Our findings show that a network of peers with cross-cutting ideological preferences will still amplify disproportionate numbers of partisan frames. Beginning with fully randomized probabilities, the output from our experiments is more extreme than the preference of the median users, as partisans activate more frame elements than non-partisans.

In fall 2020, each of the U.S. presidential and vice presidential debates were streamed on a number of online platforms that provided an integrated streaming chat where the public could comment in real-time alongside the live debate video. Viewers could simultaneously tune into what the candidates were saying and see what a sample of their peers thought about the candidates. This study examines large samples of comments made in social chat feeds during the livestreamed debates on the ABC News, NBC News, and Fox News Facebook pages to quantify key features associated with the quality of political discussion on these platforms. The results reveal that consistent with quasi-anonymous, constrained nature of the dynamic chat, the comments made are generally short, include a substantial degree of toxicity and insults, and differ significantly in their content across platforms. These findings underscore the importance of further study of online streaming chat as a new source of potential influence on political attitudes and behavior.","tags":["Social Media","Streaming Chats","Experiments"],"title":"Connective Effervescence and Streaming Chat During Political Debates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalia Aruguete","Ernesto Calvo","Carlos Scarscitini","Tiago Ventura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606678510,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606678510,"objectID":"f37065603aa1456aaa0092a180fe2d65","permalink":"https://www.venturatiago.com/publication_wp/trust/","publishdate":"2020-11-29T15:35:10-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication_wp/trust/","section":"publication_wp","summary":"Recent increases in uncivil dialogue, political polarization, and fake news in social media raise questions about the relationship between negative online messages and the decline in political trust.

This hypothesis is tested by estimating different specifications of logistic regression models, including fixed effects and hierarchical models for the 2005-2012 period.

Among the answers to these dilemmas, we see the emergence of the most varied innovations with a view to broaden the participatory and deliberative outlines of the contemporary political systems. Brazil is a pioneer in creating such experiences, it has become a world reference regarding academic research on the theme and reproduction of its experiences in other countries. A large part of the literature devoted to these innovations has focused its analyses on internal functioning procedures and their impact on the public policy cycle. Few analyses address such innovations having the dialogue with the participatory tradition and the constitution of countries' democratic institutions as a basis. Through a bibliometric analysis of classic studies in sociology and Brazilian political science, we aim at providing such reconstruction in this essay.
