abstract = "This article presents a novel experiment measuring the reputation and ideological costs fact-checkers face when informing voters about the accuracy of messages. The study examines how exposure to the counter and pro-attitudinal fact-checking messages impact the perceived quality and ideological leaning of fact-checking organizations. In a well-powered, pre-registered survey experiment conducted during the 2021 mid-term election in Argentina when COVID-19 was a polarizing issue, we exposed 5,757 respondents to real tweets about the number of COVID-19 cases in Argentina, followed by fact-checking corrections. Results show that pro-attitudinal messages increased the quality rating of the fact-checker, Chequeado, and made respondents perceive the organization ideologically closer to their own views. Counter-attitudinal fact-checking also increases the perceived quality but has no significant effect on ideological contrast of the fact-checker. Results from this experiment are important to devise fact-checking interventions that are reputation-improving and support the organization's long-term mission. "
