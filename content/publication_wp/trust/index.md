### Abstract

Recent increases in uncivil dialogue, political polarization, and fake news in social media raise questions about the relationship between negative online messages and the decline in political trust.  We implement a trust  game in a survey experiment with  4,800  respondents  in  Brazil  and  Mexico.   Our  design  models  the  effect  of social media on trust and trustworthiness.  Survey respondents alternate as agents (politicians)  and  principals  (voters),  with  rewards  contingent  on  their  preferred “candidate” winning the election.  We measure the extent to which voters place their trust in others and are themselves trustworthy, that is, willing to honor requests that may not benefit them.  Results provide robust support for a negative effect of uncivil partisan discourse on trust behavior and null results on trustworthiness.
