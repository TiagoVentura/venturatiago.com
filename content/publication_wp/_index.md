## Misinformation Beyond Traditional Feeds: Evidence from a WhatsApp Deactivation Experiment in Brazil. 
*R&R at The Journal of Politics*

[Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4457400)

**Abstract:** In most advanced democracies, concerns about the spread of misinformation are typically associated with feed-based social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. These platforms also account for the vast majority of research on the topic. However, in most of the world, particularly in Global South countries, misinformation often reaches citizens through social media messaging apps, particularly WhatsApp. To fill the resulting gap in the literature, we conducted a multimedia deactivation experiment to test the impact of reducing exposure to potential sources of misinformation on WhatsApp during the weeks leading up to the 2022 Presidential election in Brazil. We find that this intervention significantly reduced participants' exposure to false rumors circulating widely during the election. However, consistent with theories of mass media minimal effects, a short-term reduction in exposure to misinformation ahead of the election did not lead to significant changes in belief accuracy, political polarization, or well-being.

## Survey Professionalism: New Evidence from Browsing Data

*R&R at Political Analysis*

[Paper](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/jxdc8)

**Abstract:** Online panels have become an important resource for research in political science, but the financial compensation offered to panelists incentivizes them to become \`\`survey professionals,'' which raises concerns about data quality. We provide evidence on survey professionalism using behavioral web browsing data from three U.S. samples, recruited via Lucid, YouGov, and Facebook (total $n = 3,886$). Survey professionalism is common but varies across samples: By our most conservative measure, we identify 1.7% of respondents on Facebook, 7.9% of respondents on YouGov, and 34.3% of respondents on Lucid as survey professionals. However, evidence that professionals lower data quality is limited: they do not systematically differ demographically or politically from non-professionals and do not exhibit more response instability, although they are somewhat more likely to speed, straightline, and take questionnaires repeatedly. While concerns are warranted, we conclude that survey professionals do not, by and large, distort inferences of research based on online panels

## Keep your promises, even when your peers do not: A Survey Experiment on the Influence of Social Media on Trust

*R&R at The Journal of Information and Politics*

[Paper](https://www.venturatiago.com/talk/trust/trust.pdf)

**Abstract:** This study measures the effect of partisan and polarizing social media messages on political trust and trustworthiness in Brazil and Mexico. We implemented two survey experiments with 2,400 respondents each, using a modified "trust game" to measure the effects of social media on two dimensions: trust (the belief that others will fulfill their pledges) and trustworthiness (fulfilling the pledges made to others). Our findings reveal a null social media effect on trustworthiness and a statistically significant decline in trust among users exposed to polarizing partisan messages. The decline in trust is larger if respondents actively like, share, or comment on the message. Results show that individuals are, on average, worthy of our trust, even if we do not trust them. These findings underscore the role of active engagement with social media content as a mediator in diminishing trust. The results also raise questions about the significant gap between trustworthiness and trust.

## Testing the Causal Impact of Social Media Reduction Around the Globe

*Invited to Submit at Nature*

[Project Webpage](https://globalsocialmediastudy.com/)

**Abstract:** More than half of the world’s population now uses social media. There is widespread debate among the general public, politicians, and academics about social media’s impact on important variables, such as intergroup conflict and well-being. However, many studies on the impact of social media are either correlational or focus primarily on samples from the United States and Western Europe. We plan to conduct a global field experiment to measure the causal impact of incentivizing people to substantially reduce their social media usage across 23 countries (projected n > 8,000) for two weeks. We will then test hypotheses on how social media reduction influences four main outcomes: news knowledge, exposure to online hostility, intergroup attitudes, and well-being. We will also explore how the effects of social media reduction vary across different world regions, focusing on three theoretically-informed country-level moderators: income level, inequality, and democracy. This large-scale, high-powered global field experiment, and the global dataset resulting from it, will provide much-needed evidence to inform ongoing debates about the impact of social media usage across diverse cultural and political contexts.

## Understanding Beliefs in Misinformation: Repetition, Partisan Signals and Bayesian Processing

*Under Review*

[Paper](https://www.venturatiago.com/talk/ite/ite/pdf)

**Abstract:** Partisan motivations and repeated exposure are two dominant explanations for how individuals form beliefs about political misinformation. 
Yet, there is little research that integrates these processes, despite each pointing to different interventions to combat the spread of false information, especially in online information environments. 
In this paper, we situate both frameworks within a unified Bayesian model of belief formation and design survey experiments to explore several implications of this theoretical framework. 
We find that both partisan motivated reasoning and prior exposure (`illusory truth effects') manifest in our data, and that they exacerbate each other, painting a bleak picture of how the steady drumbeat of partisan-flavored misinformation online influences public beliefs. 
However, we also find that the duration of these biases attenuates sharply over time and that attaching warning labels to false information mitigates the manifestation of both cognitive biases.  
% The findings suggest that partisan motivations dominate belief formation in political settings, with prior exposure to misinformation playing a secondary role. 
These results contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases in political information processing and provide a structured way of thinking about how best to understand the phenomenon of online misinformation, shifting the focus from the role of mass-level beliefs for falsehoods to the role of political elites and partisan media spreading rumors.

## The Causal Effects of Exposure to Fact-checking Information on Social Media: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Twitter

[Registered Report](https://www.venturatiago.com/talk/fact-checking/fct_timeline.pdf)

**Abstract:** Social media companies and civic society rely heavily on fact-checking to counter misinformation. While numerous studies have shown the efficacy of single-shot corrective interventions, the effects of sustained exposure to fact-checking information in a realistic social media environment have yet to be tested. In this study, we conduct a one-month field intervention implemented on a widely used social media platform to analyze the causal effect of substantially increasing users' exposure to fact-checking accounts and content on resilience to misinformation and attitudinal outcomes. In our design, Twitter users will be randomly assigned to an intervention group that will have a new timeline in their accounts composed of a pre-curated list of fact-checking organizations added to the top of their Twitter feeds, and a control group where nothing is added. Over a four-week period, participants' compliance with the intervention will be consistently assessed, and two survey waves will measure outcomes of interest.

## Voting for Violence: Criminal Violence and the Election of Law and Order Politicians in Brazil

*R&R at Comparative Politics*

[Paper](https://venturatiago.com/files/ventura_voting_for_violence_jmp.pdf)

**Abstract:** This article discusses how criminal violence affects voting behavior and citizens' demand for security policies in unequal and violent societies. I propose a theory considering both the micro-level dynamics and the supply of politicians framing the menu of security policies available to voters. I argue that rather than priming on valence considerations, security policies on unequal societies work as a wedge issue in which voters' security preferences overlap with prior partisan identities and income status. Using Brazil as a case study, I apply a combination of fine-grained observational data and computational text analysis to test my argument. Results show that crime shocks increase law-and-order candidates' vote share, especially in more conservative municipalities. More importantly, within each city, the largest share of the supporters of law and order candidates come from wealthier neighborhoods after crime shocks. Computational text analysis connects law-and-order candidates and expressive support for punitive penal policies.
