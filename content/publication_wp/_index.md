## The Fact-Checking Dilemma: Corrections increase fact-checker's credibility but distort perceptions of ideological leaning

[Paper](https://www.venturatiago.com/talk/reputation/reputation.pdf)

**Abstract**: This study examines how exposure to the counter- and pro-attitudinal fact-checking messages impacts the perceived quality and ideological leaning of the fact-checker. In a well-powered, pre-registered survey experiment conducted during the 2021 mid-term election in Argentina when COVID-19 was a polarizing issue, we exposed 5,757 respondents to real tweets reporting the number of COVID-19 cases in Argentina, followed by fact-checking corrections. Results show that pro-attitudinal messages increased the quality rating of the fact-checker, \textit{Chequeado}, and made respondents perceive the organization ideologically closer to their own views. Counter-attitudinal fact-checking also increases the perceived quality but has no significant effect on the perceived ideology of the fact-checker. Corrections are reputation-improving and do not seem to backfire. However, these same corrections affect how voters perceive the ideological leaning of fact-checking organizations.

## Misinformation Exposure Beyond Traditional Feeds: Evidence from a WhatsApp Deactivation Experiment in Brazil.

[Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4457400)

**Abstract:** In most advanced democracies, concerns about the spread of misinformation are typically associated with feed-based social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. These platforms also account for the vast majority of research on the topic. However, in most of the world, particularly in Global South countries, misinformation often reaches citizens through social media messaging apps, particularly WhatsApp. To fill the resulting gap in the literature, we conducted a multimedia deactivation experiment to test the impact of reducing exposure to potential sources of misinformation on WhatsApp during the weeks leading up to the 2022 Presidential election in Brazil. We find that this intervention significantly reduced participants' exposure to false rumors circulating widely during the election. However, consistent with theories of mass media minimal effects, a short-term reduction in exposure to misinformation ahead of the election did not lead to significant changes in belief accuracy, political polarization, or well-being.

## Survey Professionalism: New Evidence from Browsing Data

[Paper](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/jxdc8)

**Abstract:** Online panels have become an important resource for research in political science, but the financial compensation offered to panelists incentivizes them to become \`\`survey professionals,'' which raises concerns about data quality. We provide evidence on survey professionalism using behavioral web browsing data from three U.S. samples, recruited via Lucid, YouGov, and Facebook (total $n = 3,886$). Survey professionalism is common but varies across samples: By our most conservative measure, we identify 1.7% of respondents on Facebook, 7.9% of respondents on YouGov, and 34.3% of respondents on Lucid as survey professionals. However, evidence that professionals lower data quality is limited: they do not systematically differ demographically or politically from non-professionals and do not exhibit more response instability, although they are somewhat more likely to speed, straightline, and take questionnaires repeatedly. While concerns are warranted, we conclude that survey professionals do not, by and large, distort inferences of research based on online panels

## Trustful Voters, Trustworthy Politicians: A Survey Experiment on the Influence of Social Media in Politics

[Paper](https://www.venturatiago.com/talk/trust/trust.pdf)

**Abstract:** This study measures the effect of partisan and polarizing social media messages on political trust and trustworthiness in Brazil and Mexico. We implemented two survey experiments with 2,400 respondents each, using a modified "trust game" to measure the effects of social media on two dimensions: trust (the belief that others will fulfill their pledges) and trustworthiness (fulfilling the pledges made to others). Our findings reveal a null social media effect on trustworthiness and a statistically significant decline in trust among users exposed to polarizing partisan messages. The decline in trust is larger if respondents actively like, share, or comment on the message. Results show that individuals are, on average, worthy of our trust, even if we do not trust them. These findings underscore the role of active engagement with social media content as a mediator in diminishing trust. The results also raise questions about the significant gap between trustworthiness and trust.

## The Causal Effects of Exposure to Fact-checking Information on Social Media: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Twitte3

[Registered Report](https://www.venturatiago.com/talk/fact-checking/fct_timeline.pdf)

**Abstract:** Social media companies and civic society rely heavily on fact-checking to counter misinformation. While numerous studies have shown the efficacy of single-shot corrective interventions, the effects of sustained exposure to fact-checking information in a realistic social media environment have yet to be tested. In this study, we conduct a one-month field intervention implemented on a widely used social media platform to analyze the causal effect of substantially increasing users' exposure to fact-checking accounts and content on resilience to misinformation and attitudinal outcomes. In our design, Twitter users will be randomly assigned to an intervention group that will have a new timeline in their accounts composed of a pre-curated list of fact-checking organizations added to the top of their Twitter feeds, and a control group where nothing is added. Over a four-week period, participants' compliance with the intervention will be consistently assessed, and two survey waves will measure outcomes of interest.

## Voting for Violence: Criminal Violence and the Election of Law and Order Politicians in Brazil

[Paper](https://venturatiago.com/files/ventura_voting_for_violence_jmp.pdf)

**Abstract:** This article discusses how criminal violence affects voting behavior and citizens' demand for security policies in unequal and violent societies. I propose a theory considering both the micro-level dynamics and the supply of politicians framing the menu of security policies available to voters. I argue that rather than priming on valence considerations, security policies on unequal societies work as a wedge issue in which voters' security preferences overlap with prior partisan identities and income status. Using Brazil as a case study, I apply a combination of fine-grained observational data and computational text analysis to test my argument. Results show that crime shocks increase law-and-order candidates' vote share, especially in more conservative municipalities. More importantly, within each city, the largest share of the supporters of law and order candidates come from wealthier neighborhoods after crime shocks. Computational text analysis connects law-and-order candidates and expressive support for punitive penal policies.
