### Welcome!

<br>

I am a Researcher at the [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterResearch) Civic Integrity and Misinformation Team. I recently  defended my Ph.D. dissertation in Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park (Fall 2021). 

My research lies in the fields of Computational Social Science and Comparative Political Behavior. My computational social science work focuses substantively on political communication, and methodologically on developing network models to deal with big data, on the use of novel image-based experimental designs, and in social science applications for natural language processing models. Meanwhile, my comparative political behavior work explores criminal violence, inequality, law enforcement politics, and preferences for harsh-on-crime policies in Latin America. 

I am currently working on a book project with Natalia Aruguete and Ernesto Calvo titled *News Sharing, Content Activation and Perceptions of Polarization on Social Media*. Our book project develops a novel theoretical explanation for the mixed-finding relating heightened levels of polarization in social media discourses and to users' sorting on social media networks and on-line media diets. Instead of focusing on online echo-chamber(sorting), our theory focuses on how social media bubbles emerge may emerge from different propensities of partisan users' to share content on social media and its upstream effects on perceived polarization. This explanation helps us understand why perceptions of polarization are so heightened among social media users, even though the levels of segregation on users’ social media networks and media consumption are not exceptionally high. 


<!-- My dissertation research focuses on criminal violence and political behavior in Latin America: how citizens make strategic decisions about security policies in violent democracies, how exposure to crime affects citizens' willingness to invest in security, and how these concerns ultimately enter into the electoral arena via support for candidates campaigning on tough-on-crime policies.-->

My research has been published at the _Journal of Communication, International Journal of Press/Politics, Electoral Studies, Digital Journalism, Journal of Elections Public Opinion and Parties, Latin American Politics and Society, The Journal of Quantitative Description (Digital Media), and The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations_. In addition, my projects have been funded through grants and fellowships from the University of Maryland, Russel Sage Foundation, EGAP, the Inter-American Development Bank, and CAPES (Brazilian Government).

I am also passionate about teaching and sharing my experience working on computational social science with other colleagues.  I have taught several workshops at both graduate and undergraduate levels, including a full semester seminar on [Introduction to Computational Social Science](https://fgvintrocss.netlify.app/) to undergraduate students. I was also the organizer of the first [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Brazil](https://sicss.io/2021/fgv-dapp-brazil/) during Summer 2021. 

<!---  Bem-vindo ao meu site!

Sou aluno de doutorado em Ciência Política na Universidade de Maryland, College Park, Estados Unidos. Minha pesquisa foca em economica política comparada e comportamento político. Minha tese propõe um modelo teórico para compreender efeito de desigualdade econômica e victimização em preferencias por políticas de segurança na América Latina. No Brasil, obtive os títulos de  Mestrado e Doutorado em Ciência Política no IESP-UERJ. Minha agenda de pesquisa focou-se principalmente em formas de medir efetividade de experiências participativas e partidos politicos.  Confira neste link os materiais do workshop [Acessando dados da web em R](https://tiagoventura.github.io/workshop_ufpa/) que ofertei na minha alma-mater, Universidade Federal do Para. -->
