### Welcome!

<br>

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/) at NYU, and a Research Fellow at the [Siegel Family Endowment](https://www.siegelendowment.org/insights/article/meet-our-2022-2023-siegel-research-fellows/). In Fall 2023, I will join the [McCourt School of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/) at Georgetown University as an Assistant Professor in Computational Social Science. I worked previously as a Researcher at  [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterResearch). 


I am a computational social scientist exploring substantive issues on political communication and political behavior. My substantive work in political communication focuses on content activation, news sharing, misinformation, and polarization on social media. I explore these issues primarily in Latin American countries. Methodologically, I am interested in online field and survey experiments, network models to deal with big data, and applications of natural language processing to social science problems. My comparative political behavior work explores issues of criminal violence and inequality in Latin America. 

<!-- I am currently working on a book project with Natalia Aruguete and Ernesto Calvo titled *News Sharing, Content Activation and Perceptions of Polarization on Social Media*. Our work combines computational modeling with social media data, several survey digital experiments and qualitative analysis across four different countries, Brazil, Argentina, United States and Mexico. The book project is a follow-up from our article "[News by Popular Demand](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19401612211057068)" recently published at the International Journal of Press/Politics. 

<!--Our book project develops a novel theoretical explanation for the intricate connection between perceptions of heightened polarization in social media discourses and the mixed empirical evidence of users' sorting in these plataforms. Instead of focusing on the formation of online echo-chambers (sorting), our theory discusses how social media bubbles may emerge from different propensities of partisan users' to share content on social media and its upstream effects on perceived polarization.
My dissertation research focuses on criminal violence and political behavior in Latin America: how citizens make strategic decisions about security policies in violent democracies, how exposure to crime affects citizens'willingness to invest in security, and how these concerns ultimately enter into the electoral arena via support for candidates campaigning on tough-on-crime policies.-->

My research has been published at the _Journal of Communication, PLOS ONE, International Journal of Press/Politics, Comparative Political Studies, Electoral Studies, Digital Journalism, Journal of Elections Public Opinion and Parties, Latin American Politics and Society, The Journal of Quantitative Description (Digital Media), and The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations_. You can download my [CV here](https://venturatiago.com/files/cv.pdf), or visit the [research page](https://venturatiago.com/talk/) for drafts of working papers currently under review.

I am a proud native of the North of Brazil, born and raised in Belém. Before moving to the United States, I lived for many years in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which is probably the most fun city in the world.  


<!-- I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Maryland College Park (2022), a Master's and a Ph.D. degree in Political Science from the State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I am a proud native of the North of Brazil, from the city of Belém. But, before moving to the United States, I developed some affection for the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro. 

<!-- I am also passionate about teaching and sharing my experience working on computational social science with other colleagues.  I have taught several workshops at both graduate and undergraduate levels, including a full semester seminar on [Introduction to Computational Social Science](https://fgvintrocss.netlify.app/) to undergraduate students. I was also the organizer of the first [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Brazil](https://sicss.io/2021/fgv-dapp-brazil/) during Summer 2021. 

<!---  Bem-vindo ao meu site!

Sou aluno de doutorado em Ciência Política na Universidade de Maryland, College Park, Estados Unidos. Minha pesquisa foca em economica política comparada e comportamento político. Minha tese propõe um modelo teórico para compreender efeito de desigualdade econômica e victimização em preferencias por políticas de segurança na América Latina. No Brasil, obtive os títulos de  Mestrado e Doutorado em Ciência Política no IESP-UERJ. Minha agenda de pesquisa focou-se principalmente em formas de medir efetividade de experiências participativas e partidos politicos.  Confira neste link os materiais do workshop [Acessando dados da web em R](https://tiagoventura.github.io/workshop_ufpa/) que ofertei na minha alma-mater, Universidade Federal do Para. -->
