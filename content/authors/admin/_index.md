I am an Assistant Professor in Computational Social Science at Georgetown University’s [McCourt School of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/). Before joining Georgetown, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at NYU’s [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/). I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, where I am still a faculty affiliated with the [iLCSS](https://ilcss.umd.edu/). After completing my PhD, I had experience in the industry as a Misinformation Researcher at  [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterResearch). 

My scholarship lies in the intersection between social media usage and politics and in developing new methods to use social media data to study politics. My research spans topics such as online content activation and propagation, measuring the causal effects of social media usage on exposure to misinformation and political behavior, and testing interventions to counter beliefs for misinformation. I primarily pursue a comparative approach to these issues, paying particular attention to Global South countries and using multi-country large-scale designs to study the intersection of social media and politics. Methodologically, I am interested in survey research in the digital space, large-scale digital experimentation, and the use of large language models in applied social science research.

My research has been published or forthcoming at leading journals in Political Science ( _The Journal of Politics, Comparative Political Studies, Electoral Studies_), Communications ( _Journal of Communication (x2),  New Media & Society, International Journal of Press/Politics_), and general interest journals ( _Nature, Nature Scientific Reports, PLOS ONE_),  among other outlets. I have been awarded with grants from Project Liberty Institute, Tech & Public Policy Initiative at Georgetown, and EGAP. My paper "Misinformation Beyond Traditional Feeds: Evidence from a WhatsApp Deactivation Experiment in Brazil" was recognized with the 2024 APSA's Paul Lazarsfeld Best Paper Award, Best Paper Award in Internet, Technology and Politics, the Best Paper in Political Behavior and best overall paper in the 2024 Brazilian Political Science Association Conference. 

Some of my ongoing projects are a large-scale collaborative global feed-based social media deactivation study; a multicountry deactivation experiment on WhatsApp in Brazil , South Africa, and India; developing a large-scale panel connecting US voter files with their Twitter accounts; developing a data donation pipeline for WhatsApp data;  and a field experiment increasing users' exposure to fact-checking accounts on Twitter. I am also working on a book project with Natalia Aruguete and Ernesto Calvo titled *News Sharing, Content Activation and Perceptions of Polarization on Social Media*. Please, reach out if you are interested in any of those!

<!-- My recent work was awarded a large research grant from the Tech & Public Policy program at Georgetown’s McCourt School to conduct multi-country field experiments focusing on the effects of misinformation exposure through social media messaging apps on beliefs for misinformation and political attitudes in the Global South.

<!--I am a proud native of the North of Brazil, born and raised in Belém, the largest city in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Region. Before moving to the United States, I lived for many years in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which is the most fun and beautiful city in the world. Like most Brazilians, I am is passionate about soccer, coffee, and samba. 

<!--I am a computational social scientist exploring substantive issues on political communication and political behavior. My substantive work in political communication focuses on content activation, news sharing, misinformation, and polarization on social media. I explore these issues primarily in Latin American countries. Methodologically, I am interested in online field and survey experiments, network models to deal with big data, and applications of natural language processing to social science problems. My comparative political behavior work explores issues of criminal violence and inequality in Latin America.--> 

<!-- I am currently working on a book project with Natalia Aruguete and Ernesto Calvo titled *News Sharing, Content Activation and Perceptions of Polarization on Social Media*. Our work combines computational modeling with social media data, several survey digital experiments and qualitative analysis across four different countries, Brazil, Argentina, United States and Mexico. The book project is a follow-up from our article "[News by Popular Demand](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19401612211057068)" recently published at the International Journal of Press/Politics. 

<!--Our book project develops a novel theoretical explanation for the intricate connection between perceptions of heightened polarization in social media discourses and the mixed empirical evidence of users' sorting in these plataforms. Instead of focusing on the formation of online echo-chambers (sorting), our theory discusses how social media bubbles may emerge from different propensities of partisan users' to share content on social media and its upstream effects on perceived polarization.
My dissertation research focuses on criminal violence and political behavior in Latin America: how citizens make strategic decisions about security policies in violent democracies, how exposure to crime affects citizens'willingness to invest in security, and how these concerns ultimately enter into the electoral arena via support for candidates campaigning on tough-on-crime policies.-->

<!-- I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Maryland College Park (2022), a Master's and a Ph.D. degree in Political Science from the State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I am a proud native of the North of Brazil, from the city of Belém. But, before moving to the United States, I developed some affection for the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro. 

<!-- I am also passionate about teaching and sharing my experience working on computational social science with other colleagues.  I have taught several workshops at both graduate and undergraduate levels, including a full semester seminar on [Introduction to Computational Social Science](https://fgvintrocss.netlify.app/) to undergraduate students. I was also the organizer of the first [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Brazil](https://sicss.io/2021/fgv-dapp-brazil/) during Summer 2021. 

<!---  Bem-vindo ao meu site!

Sou aluno de doutorado em Ciência Política na Universidade de Maryland, College Park, Estados Unidos. Minha pesquisa foca em economica política comparada e comportamento político. Minha tese propõe um modelo teórico para compreender efeito de desigualdade econômica e victimização em preferencias por políticas de segurança na América Latina. No Brasil, obtive os títulos de  Mestrado e Doutorado em Ciência Política no IESP-UERJ. Minha agenda de pesquisa focou-se principalmente em formas de medir efetividade de experiências participativas e partidos politicos.
