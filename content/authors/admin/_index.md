I am an Assistant Professor in Computational Social Science at Georgetown University’s [McCourt School of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/) and a faculty affiliated with the [Massive Data Institute](https://mdi.georgetown.edu/). Before joining Georgetown, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at NYU’s [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/). Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, where I am still a faculty affiliated with the [iLCSS](https://ilcss.umd.edu/) and worked as a Misinformation Researcher at  [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterResearch). 

My research deals with substantive issues on politics and social media, focusing on topics such as content activation and propagation, misinformation, and polarization on social media platforms. I am mostly interested in pursuing a comparative approach to these issues, paying special attention to Global South countries.  Methodologically, I am interested in causal inference problems, online field and survey experiments, network models to deal with large volumes of data, and applications of natural language processing to social science problems. 


My research has been published at the _Journal of Communication, Comparative Political Studies, Nature Scientific Reports, International Journal of Press/Politics, and PLOS ONE_, among other influential academic journals. My research has been awarded with grants from Project Liberty Institute, Tech & Public Policy Initiative at Georgetown, and EGAP, and recognized as the 2024 APSA's Paul Lazarsfeld Best Paper Award and Best Paper Award in Internet, Technology and Politics, the Best Paper in Political Behavior in the 2024 Brazilian Political Science Association Conference, and the 2022 Mario Fuks Award for the best paper presented in the Political Behavior Section in the Brazilian Political Science Political. 

Some of my current projects are a large-scale collaborative global social media deactivation study, a set of multimedia deactivation experiments on WhatsApp in Mexico, South Africa, and India, developing a large-scale panel connecting US voter files with their Twitter accounts, a field study investigating recommendation systems and censorship in Chinese social media, and field experiment increasing users' exposure to fact-checking accounts on Twitter. I am also working on a book project with Natalia Aruguete and Ernesto Calvo titled *News Sharing, Content Activation and Perceptions of Polarization on Social Media*

<!-- My recent work was awarded a large research grant from the Tech & Public Policy program at Georgetown’s McCourt School to conduct multi-country field experiments focusing on the effects of misinformation exposure through social media messaging apps on beliefs for misinformation and political attitudes in the Global South.

I am a proud native of the North of Brazil, born and raised in Belém, the largest city in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Region. Before moving to the United States, I lived for many years in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which is the most fun and beautiful city in the world. Like most Brazilians, I am is passionate about soccer, coffee, and samba. 

<!--I am a computational social scientist exploring substantive issues on political communication and political behavior. My substantive work in political communication focuses on content activation, news sharing, misinformation, and polarization on social media. I explore these issues primarily in Latin American countries. Methodologically, I am interested in online field and survey experiments, network models to deal with big data, and applications of natural language processing to social science problems. My comparative political behavior work explores issues of criminal violence and inequality in Latin America.--> 

<!-- I am currently working on a book project with Natalia Aruguete and Ernesto Calvo titled *News Sharing, Content Activation and Perceptions of Polarization on Social Media*. Our work combines computational modeling with social media data, several survey digital experiments and qualitative analysis across four different countries, Brazil, Argentina, United States and Mexico. The book project is a follow-up from our article "[News by Popular Demand](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19401612211057068)" recently published at the International Journal of Press/Politics. 

<!--Our book project develops a novel theoretical explanation for the intricate connection between perceptions of heightened polarization in social media discourses and the mixed empirical evidence of users' sorting in these plataforms. Instead of focusing on the formation of online echo-chambers (sorting), our theory discusses how social media bubbles may emerge from different propensities of partisan users' to share content on social media and its upstream effects on perceived polarization.
My dissertation research focuses on criminal violence and political behavior in Latin America: how citizens make strategic decisions about security policies in violent democracies, how exposure to crime affects citizens'willingness to invest in security, and how these concerns ultimately enter into the electoral arena via support for candidates campaigning on tough-on-crime policies.-->

<!-- I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Maryland College Park (2022), a Master's and a Ph.D. degree in Political Science from the State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I am a proud native of the North of Brazil, from the city of Belém. But, before moving to the United States, I developed some affection for the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro. 

<!-- I am also passionate about teaching and sharing my experience working on computational social science with other colleagues.  I have taught several workshops at both graduate and undergraduate levels, including a full semester seminar on [Introduction to Computational Social Science](https://fgvintrocss.netlify.app/) to undergraduate students. I was also the organizer of the first [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Brazil](https://sicss.io/2021/fgv-dapp-brazil/) during Summer 2021.

Sou aluno de doutorado em Ciência Política na Universidade de Maryland, College Park, Estados Unidos. Minha pesquisa foca em economica política comparada e comportamento político. Minha tese propõe um modelo teórico para compreender efeito de desigualdade econômica e victimização em preferencias por políticas de segurança na América Latina. No Brasil, obtive os títulos de  Mestrado e Doutorado em Ciência Política no IESP-UERJ. Minha agenda de pesquisa focou-se principalmente em formas de medir efetividade de experiências participativas e partidos politicos.
