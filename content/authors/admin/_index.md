### Welcome!

<br>

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park, and I will defend my dissertation in the Fall 2021. My research agenda centers on Comparative Political Behavior exploring issues of criminal violence, inequality, and  preferences for harsh-on-crime policies in Latin America. I am also a researcher in Computational Social Science, particularly in the field of digital experimentation, political communication, and empirical applications of text-as-data models. 

During my Ph.D.,  I have been an active member of the Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Computational Social Science (iLCSS) at UMD. While at the iLCSS, I have collaborated on a variety of computational social science projects addressing important issues in political communication, social media, and politics. For Spring of 2021, I was awarded the **Young Talent Fellowship in Computational Social Science** at FGV Rio de Janeiro. 

<!-- My dissertation research focuses on criminal violence and political behavior in Latin America: how citizens make strategic decisions about security policies in violent democracies, how exposure to crime affects citizens' willingness to invest in security, and how these concerns ultimately enter into the electoral arena via support for candidates campaigning on tough-on-crime policies.-->

My research has been published at _Electoral Studies, Journal of Elections Digital Journalism, Latin American Politics and Society, The Journal of Quantitative Description (Digital Media), and The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations_ . And it has been  funded through grants and fellowships from the University of Maryland, Russel Sage Foundation, EGAP, and the Inter-American Development Bank.

I am also passionate about teaching and sharing my experience working on computational social science with other colleagues.  I have taught several workshops at both graduate and undergraduate levels, including a full semester seminar on [Introduction to Computational Social Science](https://fgvintrocss.netlify.app/) to undegraduate students. I was also the organizer of the first [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Brazil](https://sicss.io/2021/fgv-dapp-brazil/) during the Summer 2021. 

<!---  Bem-vindo ao meu site!

Sou aluno de doutorado em Ciência Política na Universidade de Maryland, College Park, Estados Unidos. Minha pesquisa foca em economica política comparada e comportamento político. Minha tese propõe um modelo teórico para compreender efeito de desigualdade econômica e victimização em preferencias por políticas de segurança na América Latina. No Brasil, obtive os títulos de  Mestrado e Doutorado em Ciência Política no IESP-UERJ. Minha agenda de pesquisa focou-se principalmente em formas de medir efetividade de experiências participativas e partidos politicos.  Confira neste link os materiais do workshop [Acessando dados da web em R](https://tiagoventura.github.io/workshop_ufpa/) que ofertei na minha alma-mater, Universidade Federal do Para. -->
